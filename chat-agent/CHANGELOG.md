# Changelog

## Unreleased

- feat!: rename the `chat-conversations` collection to `agent-conversations` and the default `chat-token-usage` budget collection to `agent-token-usage`. Existing projects must migrate data or override `createPayloadBudget({ slug: 'chat-token-usage' })` to keep the previous slug.
- feat: show a "Responding…" indicator in the message list while the agent is working on a response but hasn't streamed any output yet, and a shimmer skeleton while conversation history is loading (initial hydration and sidebar switches) instead of a blank area
- fix: redirect unauthenticated visitors of `/admin/chat` to the login page instead of rendering the admin chrome around a "Not authorized" message

## 0.1.0-beta.3

- feat: surface tool-call status in the chat UI (running / failed / denied) and show failed tool error text in a collapsible panel instead of only a colored dot.
- feat: add an in-chat header showing the conversation title with inline rename, and move the mode / model selectors and token counter into it
- feat: make the chat view usable on narrow viewports
- fix: keep streamed messages visible after the first save of a new conversation
- fix: retarget saves to the new conversation id after switching conversations from the sidebar

## 0.1.0-beta.2

- fix: normalize all Payload label shapes (`string`, localized `Record`, `LabelFunction`, `false`) in `getCollectionSchema` / `getGlobalSchema` output instead of emitting `"[object Object]"`.

## 0.1.0-beta.1

- fix: move `@ai-sdk/react` to `dependencies` so consumer builds can resolve it
- fix: move server components to a `/server` sub-export so `payload generate:importmap` no longer crashes on transitive CSS imports
- fix: hide the `chat-conversations` collection from the admin nav
- fix: use `@payloadcms/ui` `Button` throughout the chat UI for consistent admin-panel styling

## 0.1.0-beta.0

- initial beta release
