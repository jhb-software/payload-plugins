# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add markdown rendering for assistant messages using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`
- Include admin panel URL patterns in the system prompt so the agent can produce clickable links to documents it creates, updates, or finds (respects `config.routes.admin`)
- Open markdown links in a new tab so clicking through to the admin panel preserves the current chat conversation
